This is a lightweight script that allows users to automate the saving of questions in a SQLite database, and then prompting the testing of the student in the domain of their choosing.  

Utilized primarily for personal use.  Call the function test_time() for the quiz to commence.  Call the function insert_question() to insert a question of your own.

Happy Quizzing!
